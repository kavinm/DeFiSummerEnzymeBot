Liquidate Logic:

1. Liquidate should only be passed the holdingsWithAmount object, not an array
2. Liquidate should then create the sellToken with the input holdings object
3. Liquidate performs the swap.


Index.ts Current Logic

1.Create static holdings

2.Call the bot with a strategy function

3. . check if transaction is valid, send it, handle errors if there are some 

4. If needed,  run multiple times

5. Main Function creates bot and then calls run with it

Index.ts New logic for Liquidate
MAIN
1. Create Static holdings in main


2.for each loop within main, foreach will liquidate and iterate 
through each token

RUN
3.Call the bot with liquidate function for each token

4.check if transaction is valid, send it, handle errors if there are some 


Rebalance Portfolio Logic

Inputs: Tokens that are reduced in holding, amount token is reduced by, Tokens that are increased in holdings, amount token is increased by, total value/amount of all holdings

GET TOTAL USD VALUE OF HOLDINGS (getVaultValue)

_We need to sum up the values of all token - Get value of each token
1. Check how many decimals the token has, convert into number
2. Multiply token number by price in usd with getPrice
3. We will have value of token amount in usd
4. Sum token values and store in variable
