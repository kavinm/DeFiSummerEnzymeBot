Liquidate Logic:

1. Liquidate should only be passed the holdingsWithAmount object, not an array
2. Liquidate should then create the sellToken with the input holdings object
3. Liquidate performs the swap.


Index.ts Current Logic

1.Create static holdings

2.Call the bot with a strategy function

3. . check if transaction is valid, send it, handle errors if there are some 

4. If needed,  run multiple times

5. Main Function creates bot and then calls run with it

Index.ts New logic for Liquidate
MAIN
1. Create Static holdings in main


2.for each loop within main, foreach will liquidate and iterate 
through each token

RUN
3.Call the bot with liquidate function for each token

4.check if transaction is valid, send it, handle errors if there are some 


Rebalance Portfolio Logic


GET TOTAL USD VALUE OF HOLDINGS (getVaultValue)

_We need to sum up the values of all token - Get value of each token
1. Check how many decimals the token has, convert into number
2. Multiply token number by price in usd with getPrice
3. We will have value of token amount in usd
4. Sum token values and store in variable


Inputs: (holdings of tokens and amounts before "rebalancing"),  holdings of tokens and amounts after reblancing
1. Create rebalance holdings from front end in EnzymeBot.ts
2. Pass rebalance holdings to main()
3. All rebalancing logic in main()
4. Create new swap functions with amount parameter


1. check if totalAmount before equal to total amount after, if not return nothing and front end shows popup


FIRST FOREACH
difference holdings = holdingsBefore - holdingsAfter
2. for each holding in holdingsBefore, check if it exists in holdingsAfter. If it exists, get difference.
3.  (if difference is negative, don't sell) Swap difference to WETH. if it does not exist swap entire amount to WETH (call liquidate for that token).



SECOND FOREACH
difference holdings = holdingsAfter -holdingsBefore 
4. for each holding in holdingsAfter, check if it exists in holdingsBefore. If it exists, get difference. If it doesn't just grab amount from holdingsAfter.
5.  (if difference is negative, don't buy) when swapping from WETH to holding, we need to get the amount into USD value. 
Then get amount of WETH that we need to swap for that USD value.
6. Swap the WETH USD amount from WETH to holding.
